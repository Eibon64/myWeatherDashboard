# <My Weather Dashboard>

## Description

This is a quick and easy way to check the weather in any city in the world. I built this as an exercise in understanding 3rd part api's. I used the OpenWeatherMap API to get the weather data. I also used the Moment.js library to work with dates and times. I used Bootstrap to make the page responsive and to make it look more presentable.

## Installation

No installation is required. Simply open the index.html file in your browser or visit the live site at https://eibon64.github.io/myWeatherDashboard/.

## Usage

Type in the city name and click the search button. The current weather will be displayed along with a 5 day forecast. The city will be saved to the search history and can be clicked to display the weather again. The search history will be saved to local storage so that it will be available the next time the page is loaded.
